I'm a [Junior Assistant Professor](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/raffaele.mancuso4/en) in the [Circular Innovation Ecosystems](https://site.unibo.it/circularinnovationecosystems) research group, within the Department of Management of [Alma Mater Studiorum - Università di Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en/homepage).

Previously I held a Postdoc position at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en) in the [Entrepreneurship, Finance, and Innovation](https://www.efi.polimi.it/) research group.

My research interests cover metascience, circular economy, and the impact of public policy.

Welcome in my site. I hope you enjoy it.
