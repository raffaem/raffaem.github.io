On Sunday, June 11, 2023, I presented my paper "Do Mission-Oriented Grant Schemes Shape the Direction of Science?", co-authored with [Anders Brostr√∂m](https://www.kth.se/profile/andbr/), at the [DRUID23](https://conference.druid.dk/Druid/?confId=66) conference.

Thanks again for the valuable feedback!
