CRAN [V8 package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/V8/index.html) is:

> An R interface to V8: Google's open source JavaScript and WebAssembly engine. This package can be compiled either with V8 version 6 and up or NodeJS when built as a shared library.

The corresponding GitHub repo is located [here](https://github.com/jeroen/v8).

The [Arch Linux section of its README](https://github.com/jeroen/v8#arch-linux) suggests to install [v8-r](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/v8-r) from AUR to provide `libv8.so`.

As you can see from the PKGBUILD, this will try to fetch and compile V8 through Google's [depot_tools](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git). But V8 "contains a large codebase and compilation takes a while".

It is actually much more efficient to install [nodejs-v8](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nodejs-v8) from the AUR. This will create a symlink for `libv8.so` which targets `libnode.so`, so that the R interface will link to NodeJS.

The package was provided by [JanMarvin](https://github.com/JanMarvin) in [this comment](https://github.com/jeroen/V8/issues/149#issuecomment-1327639873).

The R V8 package is a dependency of [DAGitty](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dagitty), which in turn is a dependency of [ggdag](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggdag).
