On the 13th of April 2023, I presented my paper "Do Mission-Oriented Grant Schemes Shape the Direction of Science?", co-authored with [Anders Brostr√∂m](https://www.kth.se/profile/andbr), at the [WOEPSR23](https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/research/innovation-and-entrepreneurship-research/woepsr2023.html) conference.

Thanks again for the valuable suggestions!
