In this tutorial we will see how to compile R from source and link it against Intel MKL for increased performances, on Arch Linux.

1. Intel's MKL is part of Intel's oneAPI for some years now. Install [intel-oneapi-mkl](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/intel-oneapi-mkl/) from official repo:
    
    `sudo pacman -Syu intel-oneapi-mkl`

2. We need the JDK to provide `jni.h` (will avoid an error when we'll build R), and also TexLive support for inconsolata font to build the manual (`texlive-fontsextra` will provide `inconsolata.sty`, avoiding a warning when we configure R). Of course we also need the GCC C++ and Fortran compilers, so install them if you don't have them:

    `sudo pacman -Syu texlive-fontsextra jdk-openjdk gcc-fortran gcc`

3. Next we will go to the [R website](https://cran.r-project.org/sources.html) and pick the sources of the latest version. At the time of writing, the latest stable version is 4.3.0. We will uncompress them:

    ```
    wget https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4/R-4.3.0.tar.gz
    tar -xvf R-4.3.0.tar.gz
    cd R-4.3.0
    ```
4. We will run `configure`. We need to source the oneAPI's environment variables, and setup MKL's flags for configure. We will also enable the `--enable-R-shlib` flag to build `libR.so`, which is needed for RStudio:

    ```
    source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
    MKL="-Wl,--no-as-needed -lmkl_gf_lp64 -Wl,--start-group -lmkl_gnu_thread  -lmkl_core  -Wl,--end-group -fopenmp  -ldl -lpthread -lm"
    ./configure --with-blas="$MKL" --with-lapack --enable-R-shlib
    ```

    The above code was re-adapted from [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/using-onemkl-with-r.html)

5. Next we make and install R:

    ```
    make
    sudo make install
    ```

6. Uninstall the distribution-provided R to avoid confusion. Use `-Rdd` to skip dependency check (for instance, AUR's `rstudio-desktop-bin` depends on `r`):

    `sudo pacman -Rdd r`

7. Open an instance of R and run `sessionInfo()` to check that everything is fine. BLAS/LAPACK should **both** point to Intel's MKL. If none of them or even if one of them points to OpenBLAS, then something has gone wrong. Here is how it looks like for me:

Hope to come again with some benchmarks!

[EDIT]

You need to put:
```
source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
```
in your `.bashrc` file in order to compile R packages.
